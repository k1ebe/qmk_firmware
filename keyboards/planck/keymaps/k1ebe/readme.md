# k1ebes Planck layout

The basis for this layout is the default one, but with some modifications. The alternative keyboard layouts are removed, only the Raise, Lower and Adjust layers are preserved. Left Control and Fn has switched places.

## Space layer

This layer is accessed while holding down SPACE and gives easy access to F-keys and number keys.

## To do

Finding a solution to å is a top priority. Raise + l is pt å and Lower + l is Å.

### Combo keys

TAB+Q is 1
P+Backspace is å

- Use combo keys for CTRL+V and CTRL+C
- æøå kan nok også settes som komboer
- Can the top row be set to combos for numbers? Ie QW becomes 1 and so forth. Or maybe QA is better...

## Random thoughts

Swap OS key with the blank left on Control perhaps.
